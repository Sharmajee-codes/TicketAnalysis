Ramadan,

I have been checking into your incident (IM2902692).  Although the incident indicates that you no longer have access to SAP, I cannot find any evidence that you previously had access.  You are not in the required global group and you do not have a Terminal Server Home drive available.  Unfortunately, this can not be resolved via an incident ticket.  You will need to submit an Ishop request to get your account added to the ATL_RCCTSSAPApps global group.  Be sure to include within the comments that your account also needs to be set up with Citrix TSUser access.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused.  The incident will be closed with these comments.

Thanks

HPQC 6869 is covering this issue and can be tracked with updates

TZ Interface details required from User and Syam is looking into it.
We have analyzed this issue and found that logic behind comparison is causing this failure.

Current logic for creating delta file compares current action with existing data in TZ table (zced_sap2tz_mss). If Position Action Code, company code, status code and TZ transaction code are same for current action and TZ table entry, employee record will be excluded. Employees in question(we tested with below example: 10194) have same position action code, company code, status code and TZ transaction code(TZ table contains only previous rate increase record). Only difference was dates on record. I am not sure why only these fields are being compared. If this was the original requirement, your query is answered with our analysis. If this is not, we can create a defect in HPQC, close HPSM ticket and we will work on closing defect. Please let us know your thoughts.

Bill,

I have been reviewing the incident you opened regarding access to SAP within Citrix… Unfortunately, access to the Citrix application cannot be granted using the incident ticket.  You will need to submit an ISHOP request to get your account set up for Citrix access.  Be sure to include that you need your account configured using TSUPDATE as a TSUser and that you need your account added to the ATL_RCCTSSAPAPPS global group.

Thanks

Chris

These employees are hired as of 4/4 6PM EST and Step progression ran for these employees on 4/5 2AM EST . Since the top of stack action was not new hire, interface logic considered the employee as existing employee and looked at the baseline table.
Baseline table didn’t have those records. So the employees are skipped from SAP to TZ interface.

Doug,

I have made some updates that should account for the SAP History settings.  In order to test, you would need to log out of any existing SAP sessions, wait a minute or two, and then re-launch SAP.  You will see the path being set to Z:\SAPWorkDir.

Please test and reply to this message…

Thanks

**Title from related Incident record IM2989765:
Unable to access SAP.","Related Incident IM2989765 closed.
I was engaged by the Help Desk...  The issue is related to the fact that there is a Compatibility Issue between Citrix Web Interface and IE11.  The issue is that the Web Interface site cannot detect whether or not the client is installed.  The nfuse.delta.com site is set up to fall back to the Java Client.  The resolution is to add delta.com to the Compability View settings or utilize the Enterprise XML file.  Because these users are on the Delta network, they can use the http://citrix.delta.com site (which is already in the Enterprise XML file) to access the Citrix applications.

Sent email to the user to update the compatibility view settings to resolve the issue...  Also waiting for the Enterprise XML settings to get updated...

From: Citrix, Engineering
Sent: Tuesday, May 2, 2017 7:32 AM

Subject: IM2998407

I have reviewed your incident … This error looks like the user is trying to access the Citrix environment using the Java Client.  There are a couple reasons where this could be the case…

1.	The user does not have the Citrix Receiver client installed on their workstation. --- In this case, the user should contact their IT department to have them install the latest Citrix Receiver client.
2.	The user is trying to access the https://nfuse.delta.com environment using Internet Explorer v11. --- There is a known issue accessing the Citrix Web Interface site using Internet Explorer v11.  The browser needs to run the site in Compatibility mode in order to detect whether a client is installed.  If the site cannot detect the Citrix client, it will fall back to the Java Client.  To add the site to the Compatibility view settings, follow the instructions below:
a.	Open Internet Explorer …
b.	Click on the Tools menu or ICON (looks like a gear in the upper right corner of the browser window).
c.	Select the Compatibility View Settings option
d.	Enter delta.com in the section labelled ‘Add this Website’ and click the ADD button.  This should move the delta.com entry down to the section labelled ‘Websites you’ve added to Compatibility View’.
e.	Click Close to close the Compatibility View dialog ...
f.	Close and re-open the Browser
g.	Navigate to https://nfuse.delta.com and logon as normal.

This should eliminate the Java error…

If you are using a Delta managed workstation, the resolution will come as a result of the Enterprise XML file (when it is updated) …  Adding delta.com to the Compatibility View Settings could still be used as a workaround but the setting would likely need to be removed once the Enterprise XML file is updated.

Please reply back with you with your results as to whether you can launch applications in Citrix or not…
