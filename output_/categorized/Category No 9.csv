BAB - Arrived at gate at 0931 and they had finished boarding.  Red coat was on phone with someone (guessing ODS from comments) and said no one was able to fix it.  I tried to minimize SNAPP to check on Checkstone but it would not minimize.  Closed via task manager and found checkstone and spawnapp were both not running.  Started spawnapp and checkstone came up and reader was now working, took 30 seconds. User logged into SNAPP and confirmed.
I have sent these steps to knowledge management team awhile ago so they can add this to KMS for the helpdesk/ODS to reference and use to avoid delays but am not seeing KMS has been updated yet.  A restart of the computer would have solved the issue as well.  Agents had plenty of time as I see the original flight time had already been delayed 20+ mins by another issue.
