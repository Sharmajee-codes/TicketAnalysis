Solution: 12-7-16 I checked Amag and ran a report and could see transactions from yesterday. I ran a status on the panel and found the super panel was offline. I reset the super panel and it came back online it was controllingredients panel 03 which has the two handicap reader's on it. I tested the readers and neither reader would work. I could send an unlock command to the door lock. I took a reader to the panel and it test good on both readers ports. I removed the entry reader from the pole and it started working.

Subject: Citrix - Blank Log On Pad


I spoke with our Citrix Engineer yesterday , he told me they are receiving the tickets on the blank log on pads and have found out that the group that is adding the global groups  (iShop) are not running the  users profile through the TS update Script.  If we continue to get calls about blank log on pads, have them do the following:

1.	Launch IShop at http://www.ishop.delta.com
Enter your credentials.
2.	Go to Access/ID.
Select the Modify User Access.
Click on the Open Form(s) Button.
3.	Verify all the information on the Requestor Tab and then click the Next Button.
Fill in all required fields, then under the Secure Access Information type the the message Run ID through the TS Update Script.   Also indicate if its ECC (your regular SAP) or EWP ( New Warehouse access)  You can select Read-only.
4.	Click the Submit Button when the form(s) is complete and ready for submission.

If you need further assistance with this, please send an email to the IShop support group via email.  The address is ISHOP in outlook.

Daron,
Ronald Whaley opened this incident with the IT helpdesk and does not have an email address in the Pathore LMS.  As Ronalds manager, would you share the information in the Resolution/Action section below?  Thanks!
Resolution/Action:
You have been reset for the assessment.  IE 11 requires this setting for courses to work properly in LMS.  Here are instructions for IE 11
1.	In Internet Explorer, Click Tools
2.	From the dropdown, click Compatibility View Settings
3.	From the pop up, un-check both ""Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View"" and ""Use Microsoft compatibility list""
4.	In the ""Add this website"" field add delta.com then click ADD
5.	In the ""Add this website"" field add pathlore.net then click ADD
6.	Click Close and Log in to LMS as usual
Other Delta websites may not use Compatibility mode, so please reverse these settings when finished with LMS.

Subject: Lee Moore Access (762826/076282600)

Don,

Lee no longer has access to log into a Windows computer if he needs to, and mainly this causes him to no longer have access to Deltanet.

Seems that his account is showing expired as of 2/12/2016.

You need to go to ishop (via Deltanet) and use the correct form to change his expiration date.

The form you need is SSID Modify Contractor / Vendor ID.

See note from our knowledge base below

http://itkms.delta.com/win2kusertool/troubleshooting/edb/00004.htm

No Incident tickets should be opened. Advise the user to have their Manager complete IShop form SSID Modify Contractor/Vendor ID, extending their expiration date.

Name:	Moore, Lee A
Legal First Name:	Lee
Middle Initial:	A
Legal Last Name:	Moore
Source (Owner):	IShop Contractors
Mint Status:	open
Employee Type:	Non-Employee
Expiration Date:	2/12/2016
City:	dfw
Cost Center:	5680
Job Code:	99973
Title:	Cargo Agent
Department:	CGO DOMESTIC OPERATIONS
Company:	Airport Terminal Services, Inc.



Once you submit this request, you will receive a Q number (quote). This quote number is needed to follow-up on request etc


Hope this helps!!

The DL_PPR_NUM column value in the V_STF_MPS_MBR view for the employee has a different value, since normally it is the 9digit DELTA ID (0xxxxxx00) and the employee is a DGS employee and thus follows the 86xxxxxxxxx format for the column's value, and this value is what MPS Activity uses and compares to the employee profile's emp_nbr values. As a resolution, an EMPLOYEE, EMP_PROFILE and PDN_SYS_ASGNMT record values was added with EMP_NBR equal to the employee's V_STF_MPS_MBR.DL_PPR_NUM value.

Hi Sangeeta,

We have an incident ticket for NEWS. Looks like an access issue. When user logs into NEWS he is directed back to DeltaNet. He asked his co-worker to login to NEWS using his computer. His co-worker is able to login. User reported that the issue started when he changed job positions. Can you check if the user has access?

Let Orlando know I will call him back in 15 mins.

You have been reset for the course.  If you are using a Delta computer, following these instructions:
1.	In Internet Explorer, Click Tools
2.	From the dropdown, click Compatibility View Settings
3.	From the pop up, un-check both ""Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View"" and ""Use Microsoft compatibility list""
4.	In the ""Add this website"" field add delta.com then click ADD
5.	In the ""Add this website"" field add pathlore.net then click ADD
6.	Click Close and Log in to LMS as usual
Other Delta websites may not use Compatibility mode, so please reverse these settings when finished with LMS.

If you are using your personal computer and using the ExtraNet to login, follow these instructions:
The solution is to use the ACS Contractor link on the ExtraNet home page, do not log into the ExtraNet. Using this link will put you directly into the Pathlore LMS. The password for this is different than the Passport password.  Your current password is Delta1.  You will be asked to change it upon login.  You can take the training from there.

Mamoudou,

	As you can see from the screenshot below, to be able to open the Access database Dept 125 overtime program, the group DE_LGA_FLT_TRN needs to be in your 6 digit account.

	Below are screenshots of the groups you have for DE_LGA and the ones Kirstee has for hers. You will notice she has DE_LGA_FLT_TRNG and you dont.

	When you submit your i-Shop request, ask to have that group specifically added to your 6 digit ID  903830

The work around options for the users are as following.

1)	User need to contact their ISP to  find out what is the work around to disable their DNS hijacking.
2)	Change the ISP provided router / broadband modem  client DHCP setting on DNS configuration to external DNS server like Google DNS 8.8.8.8
3)	Some of the ISP provider router / broadband modem may not have that option then user may have to install another router in order to setup the client DNS configuration to external DNS server.

In this case you need open an Ishop to request this access, because we can't grant any access through an Incident Ticket.

Hi Shawn,

Below mentioned users are not been granted access to the mailbox Delta_RESReportRep@delta.com.

Also the security group which grant full access permission to the above mailbox is Delta_RESReportRep_MB. So this group must be converted into SSGM group. Please submit an Ishop to create  shared mailboxes with an Owner controlled security group for the mailbox that uses a tool called SSGM (Self Service Group Management).

By doing this, all access to the shared mailbox is now directly controlled by the owners of the shared mailbox.  The owners themselves will be able to add or remove individuals from the security group, which then grants or removes access to the shared email account.  The owners must be a Delta Manager and one or more employee.


Thank You,

Hello Aishwarya,

I checked your ID in RACF and TopSecret, and for production environments your ID is active without any restriction, but for DTPLEX and SAPLPLEX was revoked, in this case I resumed your ID in these environments and changed your password.

Follow your initial password:

Randy.
I compared that machine below to Matt Bietzs (XMSPBLDJ00581).  Machine below was missing terasso.dll and 3 other files.  I was just going to copy over the files when I lost Matts machine.

You could compare it to one of these.  Compare c:\program Files (x86)\teradata\.  You can also check on the x64 side (c:\program files\teradata) but I dont usually see missing files there.

Helpdesk team,

Discussed with user and below was suggested as a further troubleshoot to fix this issue.QA Tools Admin won't have the ability to run the instructions with admin rights on users PC's.Advised user to reply back to the  mail communication sent to her if in case any further issues and we will assist accordingly.

the issue seems to be with downloading a required QC client component on the workstation.Since you were able to access QC before but recently encountering the issue,we suspect there could be a conflict of QC client components with any radia updates that has been received on the PC.In this case,you can follow up with the helpdesk to run through the below steps.
Note: QA Tools Admin team wont have the ability to remote into users workstation to run the below steps with admin rights.It has to be someone from the helpdesk team that needs to run with elevated rights.

Launch IE32 browser with admin rights (required only once) and enter the URL  : http://www.qc.delta.com:8080/qcbin/start_a.jsp which allows to load the required client components of QC
Once the login screen appears, then you can try login with your QC credentials. This basically allows to register the QC client components with your profile on the PC.
You can then try opening a IE32 bits browser without admin rights and load QC.

At times running a  GPUpdate /force command on the PC also helps to ensure policy has been properly applied and then relaunch QC with admin rights.This can also be checked by IT helpdesk team.

If the above didnt help,then they can run below steps

http://www.qc.delta.com:8080/qcbin/ALM-Platform-Loader.msi , download and install it first and try again launching QC with admin rights as mentioned above.

Worked with Phil griffin on this case and user confirmed everything was working correctly:
02/14/17 20:09:24 US/Eastern (255030):
Customer had multiple local (TEMP) profiles on the workstation. I was unable to rename the server profile so I contacted Daniel Lopes (SPO) and he was able to assist. Customer tried to log back in , but did NOT create a new profile directory on the server. I got back with Daniel and he ended up creating a NEW directory for the customer. We had her move to a different workstation (which had it's own share of issues) and after cleaning everything up she was able to log in AND create a NEW profile on the server. I helped her set up her Outlook and she verified that everything was working correctly.

Hi Kristen,

Access for the folder will not be provided through Incident.

You have to raise an Ishop request with complete data path or secure group name to grant access to the folder.

With reference to the Ishop Q1014014-001, as you requested provided access to the folder Delta Global Services and DGS ADMIN.

Hence closing this incident.

Thanks,

Hi Karen,

I am closing the incident for the AutoCAD issue with your pc. Contact me directly if you are still experiencing issue.

Thanks

Hours: Monday-Friday 7:00AM-3:30PM


AutoCAD was not set as the default program to open the drawings. Had another user from the department login and tried accessing the drawings and got the same error. Was able to set AutoCAD as the default program under this users profile and the user was able to open drawings without problem but not sure if this took effect with all profiles on pc. User is working third shift (10:30pm). If the problem was resolved.

This was a definite issue, we believe related to a Deltanet issue that we understand is being worked, or may have been corrected by now.  The user stated that he was now able to get in, unlike the situation for the past day.  I also informed the user of the iCrew Direct logon, from icrew.delta.com, which can be used when not connected to Delta in any way, not connected to a Delta network, and not connected to Deltanet.  So, if Deltanet is having issues, connecting with iCrew Direct is a viable alternative.  In this case, the problem has been apparently corrected, as he was able to successfully connect to iCrew from Deltanet.

I tested several times, but was unable to replicate the issue. Jason was locke dout. Unlocked his account and he was able to log in. Had other users test, and they were able to log in. Suspect a short interuption possibly related to Symantec issue from Friday, but I did not experienced an interuption myself.

Emailed Chris and John back with findings:
What I found was that a wired and wireless connection were both active. The wireless was set to auto connect to MLU. I removed this setting, so that it would not cause any conflict. Wired is the way that it should be connected. I brought both IE and Firefox and browsed to outside websites with no problem. Everything seems to be fine with machine now.

Hi,

I was sorry to hear that you have been having troubles recently with iCrew access, passwords, etc.  I tried calling you, but received no answer, so Im sending this email in reply.  We received an incident which stated:

These issues are not unique to you, but we have been hearing a number of reports of pilots (and flight attendants) having password issues.  We also believe many are NOT having issues.  Approximately 400 crew members, on average, have an expiring password on any given day.  I understand that the Help Desk is receiving 10-12 calls per day regarding password problems, most of which sound similar to your issues.

The iCrew application has not changed, but a recent change occurred regarding passwords which we believe may have caused these issues.  The mainframe which runs in the background (for which iCrew is the GUI interface) was recently upgraded to accept Mixed Case passwords.  This was a necessary security improvement which Delta has wished to implement for years, and which was implemented on February 22.  Unfortunately, all of the various password systems within Delta are not yet completely coordinated in regard to requirements.  Some require mixed case, some require mixed case or all uppercase, and some allow any case.  We think that this has most likely interfered with password synchronization between systems in some cases.  It is my understanding that the password synchronization group is working on improving and ultimately correcting all synchronization issues, but I dont think everything has been corrected yet.

On the iCrew/mainframe side, the mainframe currently requires all uppercase letters (in addition to the 1 number which is required), or mixed case (and 1 number).  Typing in all lowercase letters in the iCrew password change function results in an Internal Server Error message, which is obviously not helpful, but not within our ability in iCrew to change.  When this occurs, no passwords have been changed.  In other cases, the password is correctly changed in iCrew, but it is not always properly synchronized to other systems.  There may also be cases in which synchronization does not occur properly when changing the password through other mechanisms.

Were sorry that some iCrew users are experiencing issues, and were trying to do our part to help alleviate the problems and get everything corrected.  The password synchronization group has the biggest piece of this process, and they are working on the issue as well.  As long as you have your password straightened out (which I hope is the case by now), or at least have the ability to log on to all Delta systems, all I can offer is to ask that you bear with us as the various groups at Delta with a stake in this issue work together to finalize a solution.  If you would like to communicate further with us about this issue, or about any iCrew issue, please feel free to respond to this email and we will get back to you when possible.  This mailbox (Feedback, iCrew) is monitored, but not every day, as it is not intended for urgent issues.

Hopefully, all of the password issues will be resolved in the near future.  Thank you for your patience.

Thanks,
Bill
iCrew Team

Pat,
As we discussed this morning we have not had Citrix access on the Panasonic side since last night.
Unfortunately this will impact PTS heavily until rectified.
We have given all of the details to our IT department as well.
There is no way for me to know if this is an issue on the Delta or Panasonic side.

I cannot get into deltanet, as I have always been able to do for years.

(19:34:36) AMY SHARP said:
I'll clear browser for the 4th time..thank you.

(19:35:31) You said:
Make sure that ""Preserve Favorite website data"" is unchecked .  The others under that are chked , except password.

(19:37:23) AMY SHARP said:
I do not see ""Preserve Favorite website data""

(19:38:03) You said:
ok, on th epage you're on, click cntrl-shift-del at the same time.

(19:38:52) You said:
""Delete Browsing History"" should come up if you are using a windows pc and any browser.

(19:40:28) AMY SHARP said:
I unchecked ever box. It only has Browsing History...not ""delete Browsing History

(19:41:27) You said:
ok.. but the one that say""preserve favorite website data""  is the only one  unchecked.

(19:42:08) You said:
when you cntrl-shift-del, the very top or the window is named ""Delete browsing Hstory""

(19:42:25) AMY SHARP said:
actually. I unchecked everything?

(19:42:52) You said:
nooo.. check all except the ""preserve"" one

(19:43:17) You said:
Some save passwords in the browser, so uncheck that one

(19:43:33) AMY SHARP said:
Only this Windows 10...there is nothing I see that says,Preserve favorite website data! I do not see that

(19:43:51) You said:
ohhhhh. win 10.... ok.. one moent.

(19:44:24) You said:
Are you using Edge or IE?

(19:45:57) AMY SHARP said:
My guess would be IE

(19:48:17) You said:
click or tap the More actions icon in Edge (the ellipses at the top right) and then select Open with Internet Explorer.

(19:48:59) AMY SHARP said:
There is nothing that says..More actions.

(19:49:21) AMY SHARP said:
Not sure if I have Edge or IE

(19:49:28) You said:
So no ellipses?

(19:49:34) You said:
top right?

(19:50:52) AMY SHARP said:
NO! if ony I could send a snap shot of what is there in the top right! Not a fan of Windows 10

(19:51:38) You said:
Me neither... ok... lets see... are you able to to search for "" internet Explorer"" ?

(19:52:51) AMY SHARP said:
I'll look.......

(19:52:57) You said:
ok

(19:56:01) AMY SHARP said:
I'm in, after I type Internet Explorer. Have no idea how, but appreciate your help this evening!

dns search suffix looks fine
Suttner, Ed 7:21 AM
It's back up.  On the server SATLRCCDLAP1044, I had to stop the Autodesk server, start it, and reread the license file.  The incident IM2960470 can be closed.
User John Stonebraker verified it's back up.  I tried from 2 lab machines also.
Brown, Randy 7:26 AM
That got it ... Thank you sir...
Suttner, Ed 7:27 AM
You're welcome Randy

I told Eryn to contact her manager and request a different log in extension, getting the system to call back when she tries to log in, is a call volume issue.

From our conversation, Jeremy indicated the problem was with the format of the CMM page in that the information icon was not showing in the proper location on the page after performing a FIND on the page.  As we could not recreate the issue and we will be migrating to the new Citrix environment next week, he agreed to close out this ticket and we would re-address if the issue occurred witihin the new environment.

Marie,

I have reviewed your incident ticket  From the information within the incident, it looks as though you looking for information and not having an actual incident.  Ill attempt to provide a flow for you to start the request process indicated in the incident.

Regarding your request, you are trying to set up a new user with access to Citrix and email.  As part of the Citrix team, we do not work too much with regards to setting up a Delta email address.  I believe that both the Citrix and Email access is requested using the IShop Process within Delta.

Providing that you are able to submit IShop requests, you would logon  to https://ishop.delta.com using your Passport ID.  Once logged on, you would complete and submit the appropriate form to request access.

I took a look at the IShop page and think that the following selections would be a good starting point

	Email -  Expand the New Hire / Transfers section of the form  Select the Create / Delete Users Delta Email Address and click the green Open Forms button.  Complete the form and submit.
	Citrix Access - Expand the Access / IDs section of the form  Select the Modify Users Access form and click the green Open Forms button.  You may be able to use the Modify Users Access form under the New Hires / Transfers section as well  Complete the form and Submit.

Note:  In both scenarios, do not be afraid to use the Comments section to expand on the request that you are looking for  In other words, be as descriptive as you can  If you know the Citrix groups that the user needs, include those in the request as well.  An example of the comments section might be Please configure user 123456 for TSGuest Access and add the user to the ATL_RCCTSSAPApps global group 

The following represents a sampling of some different Citrix groups along with the applications that are associated with the group

ATL_RCCTSSAPApps 	SAP
ATL_RCCTSHyperion	Hyperion Web v11 (Brio)
ATL_RCCTSRightSite	Documentum Webtop
CtxSmartView		SmartView in Excel
CtxOffice2010		Office Suite (This requires that the user has a Delta MSOffice license).

As this incident does not really reflect an issue, I have marked the IMPACTED ENDED and will close the incident tomorrow. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this email.

Thanks

Chris Shriner

Luis,

I reviewed the incident that you opened  From what I understand, you are indicating that you now longer have access to Access 2010 in Citrix.  We recently upgraded the Citrix environment to new servers and the newer Access 2013 product.  All access that was on the Access 2010 application was transitioned to the new Access application.

I checked your Windows ID and it does not appear that you are entitled to Microsoft Access.  I see that you are a member of the ATL_RCCTSSAPApps and ATL_RCCTSOffice2007 global groups.  The ATL_RCCTSOffice2007 group only provides access to Microsoft Excel and Word in Citrix.  I also checked our logs to see if you had launched Access during the last week but could not find any launches.

If you have a requirement for Access in Citrix, you will need to submit an IShop request to get access to the CtxOfice2010 global group.  This would provide you access to the suite of products.

Since access is not granted as part of an incident, I am closing this incident using this email

Thanks

Chris

**Title from related Incident record IM2989765:
Unable to access SAP.","Related Incident IM2989765 closed.
I was engaged by the Help Desk...  The issue is related to the fact that there is a Compatibility Issue between Citrix Web Interface and IE11.  The issue is that the Web Interface site cannot detect whether or not the client is installed.  The nfuse.delta.com site is set up to fall back to the Java Client.  The resolution is to add delta.com to the Compability View settings or utilize the Enterprise XML file.  Because these users are on the Delta network, they can use the http://citrix.delta.com site (which is already in the Enterprise XML file) to access the Citrix applications.

http://citrix.delta.com

Setup for java fallback. Doesn't see client...

javaclient (doesn't work)

Compatibility view since

Subject: RE: Delta CFS error

Hi Craig

Thanks for checking up on this. The issue was resolved when our network team had whitelisted the csg.delta.com<http://csg.delta.com> in addition to the nfuse.delta.com<http://nfuse.delta.com>. I was concerned there were other sub-domains that get launched within the delta.com<http://delta.com> site but Ive asked our network/security team to check why allowing delta.com<http://delta.com> domain would not also allow subdomains.

There are additional changes coming up on our end so we will be on alert for any reported issues and we will do some testing on our end as well. Unfortunately, our IT Maintenance and Engineering team does not have access to all Delta modules so we could only check those links we had access to.

Thanks,
Misti


This is an HA PC that is accessing DL content through Citrix via an SSL certificate. This has always worked until this week when HA put an app in place on their network that switches out the SSL certificate for another one for some reason. This was explained to me by HA Sonia who didn't have a tot of technical details on this process, but will send me an e-mail with as much info as she can on it. On the up side, HA has rolled back this change so the PC is now working as it did before and the issue has been temporarily resolved. But HA does want to implement this change once we figure out how to process it through our systems.

Sent Cheryl the following email:

Hi Cheryl,

The phone number associated to Stevens MiFi is 404-694-8624 with an upgrade eligibility date of 7/3/2017.  As an FYI, upgrading now would cost the full retail price of $199.99.

Have you tried performing a factory reset on the device?  If the Mifi is not physically broken, it could be a software issue and a lot of times a factory reset resolves this.  Follow the instructions here: https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/knowledge-base-122340/

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Hi, I am local support for P Michael and Edward.  This issue has affected 99 users in the Delta CMO office.  Users still have to set the proxy to AMCProxy.faa.gov to access the Citrix Delta Portal when on the FAA network.  The issue is when they are teleworking.  FRAC login will not allow them to set the proxy.  This issue started when the FAA stop using the proxy setting.  The manager for the Delta CMO is Michael Drew.

Michael,

Will you please contact Delta for a Delta IT tech to work with the FAA FRAC Support folks and Neil?

Neil,

We will gladly help where possible.  Before digging into anything, though, I have one question:

Have you tried adding a proxy exception for FRAC (specifically the *.ftiharris.com domain) on the client machine?  This has shown to correct similar issues in the past.

Thank you,

Database ATLDAGDLMB-BE-01 was unavailable but issue was repaired rebooting server SATLRCCDLMB913 which rejoined server to cluster network (SATLRCCDLMB910 contains a failsafe copy of the database but was not activated because it is currently offline from cluster network due to problems related to IM2934900 which are still being troubleshot.

Steve Hanson with the wireless team spoke with Scott Harris and what is actually happening here is that the pilots are seeing weak bleed over of the concourse SSID A800G - the signal is not strong enough to use because the SSID is not being advertised in the lounge. The pilots should continue to make use of N998G in the lounge and A800G in the concourse or AC cockpit if the AC is at the gate.

It sounds like the user is using an outdated link to get to the latest ESS.

As discussed, I am following up on our conversation with this email

In our conversation, you mentioned that you are launching your Citrix applications using the external Web Interface (https://nfuse.delta.com).  From the description of the incident, you are receiving problems while accessing your applications.  This is due to the fact that nfuse.delta.com is not running in compatibility mode and is falling back to the Java client.

To resolve the issue, there are a couple options

1.	Add delta.com to the compatibility view  If you are using a non-managed workstation, you can add delta.com to the compatibility view settings by following the steps below:
a.	Launch IE 11
b.	Click on the Tools Option >> select Compatibility View settings
c.	Enter delta.com in the Websites to Add box and click ADD.  This should move delta.com to the websites added section of the dialog.
d.	Click OK to close the Compatibility View dialog.
e.	Close IE 11.
f.	Go through the process to access your Citrix applications.

You may need to completely remove and reinstall the Citrix Receiver client if the compatibility viewer does not work

1.	Open Control Panel >> Programs and Features >> Remove the Citrix client (if installed)  The Citrix client may be represented by Citrix Receiver, Citrix Online Plugin, or Presentation Server Client.  There is a Citrix Receiver Removal Utility that can be used to completely remove the registry settings  This utility can be downloaded from https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX137494  -- you may need to create an account to download.
2.	Reboot the server.
3.	Logon to the workstation using Administrator privileges.
4.	Open a web browser and navigate to http://receiver.citrix.com
5.	Download the Citrix Receiver  I would not install through the browser, just save the file at this point.
6.	Open the folder location where the Citrix Receiver install was saved
7.	Right click on the Citrix Receiver Install file and select to Run as Administrator to install.

Please reply back with any test results and additional information.  I have left the incident open until your comments are received

Thanks

Chris Shriner

speak to someone in spo. Give him the profile path \\natladmhqrfs03\profiles_oo$ tell him to find the folder (profile id) and rename the folder inside it.

Aldo finally got to the phone to rename the profile after more than an hour of attempting to work with the user who was very patient.

During the time that Aldo worked on changing the users profile, the user logged on which prevented the rename to be successful
