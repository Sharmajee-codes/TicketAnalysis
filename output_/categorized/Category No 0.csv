Closing ticket: Below email sent to user advising user to submit iShop for special request.

Good morning Rick,

I am responding to your ticket IM2952153  regarding installing Dropbox on your laptop. Unfortunately, Dropbox is not a Delta supportive cloud to use. Many using it for data storage purposes not IT do not support it. You will need rights to install the software onto your laptop. You may submit an iShop special request for local admin access. The IT Security team will review your request and may grant you a 7 day Admin privilege to your local laptop so you can install the Dropbox software.

Many do not know this but using the free Dropbox version is only for personal usage not corporate usage. In order to use for corporate data storage, license will need to be purchased through DropBox. Thats DropBoxs policy. If you need to store important Delta related data please submit iShop in to increase your network shared drive storage (your I drive).
