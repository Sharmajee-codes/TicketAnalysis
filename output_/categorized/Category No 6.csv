After spending hours trying to obtain the GE BladePlot program I now have it loaded.

If anyone else needs the GE BladePlot program loaded on their laptops here is the procedure to follow.

I contacted the Help Desk and had them generate a Trouble ticket for a Field Engineer to Install the GE Blade plot Program. I also provided the Field Engineer the below information so they would know where to pull the program from since they don’t readily have this information.

Ed Suttner is the DT guy that normally handle’s this but he has been off, the above process was very simple after doing all the leg work.

There are two folders on \\QATLW7TOBO30.cfdelta.cfrl.delta.com\C$, GE Blade Plot and HP Mobile Printer.

A network drive can be mapped using CFDELTA\InstallApp, password Windows7.

The two folders need to be copied to Paul's machine.  I copy them to C:\LocalFiles.  Admin rights are needed to install both apps.  I believe the Mobile Printer needs to be attached during the installation of the software for it.  The Mobile Printer is in St. Louis, so we may need to wait until Paul has access to the Mobile Printer for its software to be successfully installed.

Field Ops or ODS can do this.

As a test, worked with Lucerne's laptop. Logged in with admin account and loaded drivers. Printer is not available. Logged out and had user log back in. Had her go to the All Programs/HP/ and run the Setup Printer and software. As soon as she choose this it stated that policies prevent this.

Thank you for contacting Delta IT Helpdesk, this is Fretwell, Jennifer

One moment while I review your issue...

Would you please confirm your phone number, area code first:

(10:05:54) You said:
How are you today Lori?

(10:05:58) Lori Whaley said:
6128050515

(10:06:14) Lori Whaley said:
pretty good

(10:07:07) You said:
Lori in order to install a personal computer you are correct, you must have administrator rights, but you must create an iShop request to have 7 day temporary rights.  Have you completed a request?

(10:07:24) Lori Whaley said:
I did

(10:07:49) Lori Whaley said:
I didn't realize it was only for 7 days.  I am probably outside that

(10:07:56) You said:
Have you received an email that it has been completed and did you attempt the install within 7 days?

(10:08:17) You said:
Okay, then you'll have to create another and install within the 7 days.

(10:08:42) Lori Whaley said:
no way to get in through today?  I'm working remotely and need to print

(10:09:34) You said:
Unfortunately not.  Those rights are setup by a different department and the Service Desk does not have the rights to do so even if we wanted.

(10:09:50) Lori Whaley said:
ah.  thank you

(10:09:56) You said:
Sorry for the inconvenience

	Hmm…I rebooted the laptop before kicking off the install and made a point of not connecting to the laptop with anything. And I used RRC to kick off the install. That is the only thing that should have been touching the set.

	Given that the manual solution sounds time consuming, is somebody willing to take that on or are we looking at a rebuild?

Rad will not install if the user is logged in: physically, via rdp or via dameware.  It’s compounded if the user has ‘broken’ a connection with the system without fully logging out first, they are still logged into the system and that causes problems with the install.  It also won’t install via Radia if a manual install was previously done to the system.  There’s been some previous issues that looks like someone may have taken it upon themselves to work outside the system and that looks to have compounded the problems.

Thing is there appears to have been some hand manipulations or something else done via non-radia methods to the install.  The installer is incapable to dealing with whatever has been done in the past to the system outside of the approved methods.

There are only 2 recovery options unless Jason has some means: first is to fully remove RAD including unentitled it via active directory and do a Radia connect.  Once that’s done, do a full cleanup of the system to remove every last remnant of RAD  then with a prior reboot, system online overnight and no one logged in,  let radia install the app and hope all remnants are gone from the system.  Second option is to reimage the system and let everything go in fresh.

There is no verify or repair on RAD.  It’s an all or nothing scenario – either it works or it doesn’t and there’s no fix other than getting it ‘all’ off and starting over from a clean slate.

Sorry – that’s the nature of this particular application.

	Earl,
	
	Could take a look at Arnab’s laptop for RAD installation? I did all the steps specified in the documentation last night and Radia is indicating everything is properly installed. So, I’m out of options short of a rebuild.

Issue started as soon as 2013 was installed this morning and Excel hasnt' worked properly since the install.
Open the Microsoft Office program and open its Options window. Click on Office ORB or FILE menu present in the ribbon and then click on Options.
2. Now go to Advanced tab and scroll down to bottom. You'll find ""Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)"" option present in General section.
3. Make sure its unchecked. If its enabled in your system, disable it by unchecking the checkbox.
4. Apply changes and restart Office program. It should fix the problem.
PS: If the option is not enabled, first enable the option and then restart the Office program. Now again disable the option and then again restart the Office program. It should fix the problem.
SOLUTION 2:
If the above mentioned solution doesn't work for you, try following method. Basically we are going to re-associate Office program as default application to open the filetype:
1. Right-click on the Office file and select ""Open with"" option.
2. If you are using Windows 7 or earlier Windows versions, click on Browse button.
3. Now go to ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office..."" folder in Browse dialog box and select the correct EXE file. For example, if you are trying to open .xlsx file, select EXCEL.EXE file. If you are trying to open .docx file, select WINWORD.EXE file.
Make sure ""Always use this application for this file type"" or similar option is enabled in Open with window.
neither solution worked.
tried change button in Programs and featuers, nothing happens. tried reinstall from Radia.

Issue has been looked at by ODS and Jack Uys and it had been determined to have workstation rebuilt.

************************************************************************************************************************************
Hello Jack, I have a workstation that IE11 will not install .... Radia shows installed successfully but user still has IE9 ...  What am I missing ?

An install was not completed - or the reboot after install didn't happen - or the user launched IE-11 before it was completely patched

ok .... I figured one of those .... So I re-ran the install myself and rebooted afterward still not working.

whats the machine name so I can take a look
Why does it have IE-9 - is it a clean build

XATLCAMP09388
Not sure .... but its not a clean build
Had laptop since last July

so how did IE-11 get uninstalled

User not sure if it was ever installed

all systems in the Enterprise were upgraded to 11

She just assumed since her whole team had IE11

connecting

Trying to give you connect

what updates is this machine installing?

Users shouldn't be able to run the updates from the web

Do you have access now ?

all that should be disabled and Radia is supposed to perform the updates
i see the screen but do not have control

Yep I understand that also
Not sure whats the deal with this workstation

could you press the unlock button to give me control

I just disconnected and reconnected

lock button onn top right of dameware screen

Its locking up everytime
I will just disconnect

retry .... dameware keeps looking up

ok

the user may need to put in the bitlocker password for the system to come back up

ok

I would recommend a rebuild of this machine - there's no telling what has occurred to prevent some of those pre requisites from installing - they all exist in the package too

ok
Thanks sir

Hey its ok

I still do not have SAS, it has tried to update numerous time.  On 5/3 Majan was able to help Jimmie Owen resolve this same issue.  Would you or someone from your team be able to help asap.

Operations Critical

If unable to resolve within 10-12 minutes, and pilot determines tablet is ""unusable"" for flight, follow the Operations Critical - Unresolved Tablet Issues process at the bottom to provide instructions to the pilot to retrieve a loaner device for flight per FAA regulations.

Check the Start Screen and All Apps list, or perform search, for the app on the tablet – if found, check version number on app tile against latest app version.
If app is installed, advise the pilot they can ignore the 'Install' or 'Processing' status in the Delta Catalog.
If app is not updated or installed:
Ensure user is signed into device and connected to internet.
Instruct pilot to process all Windows updates (click here for instructions) if not done recently.
Service Desk should login to AirWatch Ops Console, locate user’s device (with asset tag/Z # or 6-digit employee ID).
Check 'Last Seen' info on the Summary page - if not recent within a couple minutes, have the pilot restart the tablet. Once the Last Seen time is recent, continue to next step.
Check WNS Status icon at the top of the Summary tab
If WNS STATUS = CONNECTED, pilot should try the install again
