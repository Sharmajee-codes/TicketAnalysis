-Called station and spoke with Jen and she told me about the problem.
-She says that when they are boarding the plane she the scanner will intermittently go out and stop working at which point she has to board manually.
-She also let me know that sometimes the scanner will not work at all from the get go.
-I had Jen try the boarding pass scanner and it is currently working so I am ending the impact but will continue to monitor for issues.
-I gave Jen some troubleshooting tips and let her know that this is a common thing that is occurring company wide.
-told her about completely closing snapp and delta term by killing the programs through task manager or through the desktop and closing them if she does that snapp will reestablish connection with the gate reader and they are able to continue boarding.  The whole process takes less than 30 seconds to complete.

Research shows the gate reader dropped the connection to SNAPP. Submitter has been sent the steps on how to quickly recover the gate reader if and when the scenario happens again.  This is not an attributable flight delay to SNAPP.

Field Techs may say theres a DMA issue thats preventing the Gatereader from communicating with SNAPP. The DMA is an application adapter that links SNAPP with the GateReader. The steps below can resolve issues between SNAPP and the GateReader.

1.	Close the flight in SNAPP and then agent logoffs of SNAPP.
2.	Shut down SNAPP by clicking the X in the upper right hand corner of the SNAPP screen.
3.	Turn off the gate reader printer.
4.	Turn off the gate reader.
5.	Turn on the gate reader printer.

issue with WJFKGATEC61P2 was resolved by users prior to my arrival. I observed GR working normally. WJFKGATEC61P1: GR indicated to reboot PC which the agents had done but had not resolved problem. I cycled power, did an HDD check (passed)  and then powered up. PC did not proceed past minimal 5 icons for over 5 minutes (~15 icons is normaland takes 2-3 minutes). I signed in as administrator and ran a Windows scandisk. Upon completion unit loaded all icons within normal time frame and I tested SNAPP and GR successfully.

Research shows the gate reader was not properly intializing with SNAPP.  This is not a SNAPP attributable flight delay.
The steps to quickly recover the gate reader follow:  Do not reboot the work station unless the steps below fail.
These steps correct the problem 95% of the time and a reboot only corrects the problem about 5% of the time.

You must know where the power switches are on the gate reader printer and the gate reader itself to recover quickly.

1. Exit the flight in SNAPP and then logoff of SNAPP.
2. Shut down SNAPP using ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4.
3. Click YES to shut down all active browsers.
4. Turn off the gate reader printer.
5. Turn off the gate reader itself.
6. Turn on the gate reader printer.
7. Turn on the gate reader itself.
8. Start SNAPP and then reopen the flight in SNAPP.
9. If no test receipt, call the HELP DESK to create a ticket for the Field OPS Team to check the gate reader, gate reader printer,
   and the work station connections. Prepare to manually board the flight, via SNAPP.

Close out of SNAPP

Delta Proprietary Equipment:

Use ALT+F4 or CTRL+ATL+F4 to shut SNAPP down and restart SNAPP.

Common Use Equipment:

Instruct user to ALT+Tab | Click on Device Manager | Click on SNAPP icon | Choose Yes to Abort this instance of SNAPP
Have user log completely out of SNAPP and go back to the Common Use Airport Login Screen.

Power off the gate readers receipt iprinter (if one exists)


Power off the gate reader/scanner.


Power on the gate readers printer.


Power on the gate reader scanner.


Restart SNAPP and open the flight again, in SNAPP.


When the flight is open in SNAPP, try scanning a boarding pass.


If the boarding pass scans successfully, STOP HERE and continue with boarding the flight.


If the boarding pass did not scan successfully, use CTRL+ALT+Delete and then choose the LOGOFF option.  This is similar to a reboot, but is not a complete restart of the work station.


Go back to Step 6 and step through again.


If the boarding pass did not scan successfully, after the LOGOFF attempt, then the last course of action is to reboot the
workstation to recover the gate reader/scanner and scanner print device. This will take more than 6-10 minutes to reboot the
workstation and recover the gate reader/scanner.


After the reboot of the work station, Restart SNAPP, Log into SNAPP, and open the flight in SNAPP.


Scan the boarding pass again and if it scans successfully, STOP HERE and continue boarding the flight.


If the gate reader/scanner does not scan the boarding pass, after the workstation reboot, the agent has been advised to contact the help desk as it appears the gate reader hardware is malfunctioning.

Help Desk should verify the above steps were followed and if not, go back to step 1 and have agent perform steps 1-8 and continue with remaining steps 9-13 if the gate reader did not recover after the first 8 steps.

Use ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4 to shut SNAPP down and restart SNAPP.
Turn off the gate reader printer
Turn off the gate reader
Turn on the gate reader printer
Turn on the gate reader
Restart SNAPP and open the flight again, in SNAPP.
When the flight is open in SNAPP, try scanning a boarding pass.
If boarding pass scans successfully, STOP HERE and continue boarding flight
If boarding pass did not scan successfully, use CTRL+ALT+Delete, then choose LOGOFF option. This is similar to a reboot, but is not a complete restart of the work station so much faster.
Repeat steps 6&7.
If boarding pass did not scan successfully, the last course of action is to reboot workstation to recover gate reader/scanner & scanner print device. This will take more than 6-10 minutes to reboot & recover gate reader.
After reboot of workstation, Restart SNAPP, Log into SNAPP, & Open flight.
Scan boarding pass again and if successful, stop here & continue boarding.
If gate reader/scanner does not scan the boarding pass, after workstation reboot, & following steps above, engage ODS . If ODS is unable to resolve,
User wants to get a ticket, for FO instead of ODS since this is the last flight
user stated that they have a work around for the issue until FO comes out

Research shows the gate reader dropped the connection to SNAPP.  This is not a SNAPP attributable flight delay.
The steps to quickly recover the gate reader follow:  Do not reboot the work station unless the steps below fail.
These steps correct the problem 95% of the time and a reboot only corrects the problem about 5% of the time.

You must know where the power switches are on the gate reader printer and the gate reader itself to recover quickly.

1. Exit the flight in SNAPP and then logoff of SNAPP.
2. Shut down SNAPP using ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4.
3. Click YES to shut down all active browsers.
4. Turn off the gate reader printer.
5. Turn off the gate reader itself.
6. Turn on the gate reader printer.
7. Turn on the gate reader itself.
8. Start SNAPP and then reopen the flight in SNAPP.
9. If no test receipt, call the HELP DESK to create a ticket for the Field OPS Team to check the gate reader, gate reader printer,
   and the work station connections. Prepare to manually board the flight, via SNAPP.

Research shows the gate reader dropped the connection to SNAPP.  This is not a SNAPP attributable flight delay.
The steps to quickly recover the gate reader follow:  Do not reboot the work station unless the steps below fail.
These steps correct the problem 95% of the time and a reboot only corrects the problem about 5% of the time.

You must know where the power switches are on the gate reader printer and the gate reader itself to recover quickly.

1. Exit the flight in SNAPP and then logoff of SNAPP.
2. Shut down SNAPP using ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4.
3. Click YES to shut down all active browsers.
4. Turn off the gate reader printer.
5. Turn off the gate reader itself.
6. Turn on the gate reader printer.
7. Turn on the gate reader itself.
8. Start SNAPP and then reopen the flight in SNAPP.
9. If no test receipt, call the HELP DESK to create a ticket for the Field OPS Team to check the gate reader, gate reader printer,
   and the work station connections. Prepare to manually board the flight, via SNAPP.

The gate reader was not able to connect to SNAPP.  Rebooted the computer and was able to connect SNAPP to the gate reader and tested.  The delay at this gate could have been avoided if the HELP DESK did not hang up on the agent at the gate 2 times before a ticket was generated on the third call 8 minutes before the flight departed.  The agent Tammy Hall started calling in the trouble 30 minutes before the flight which is plenty of time to have a field Tech to handle the issue to prevent the delay.

Called the station to request additional information and was waiting on a call back but nobody has responded.  Based on the problem description, the SNAPP application was performing as designed since it seems the flight was open at both gate for some reason.  SNAPP will warn with an error message if the passenger is scanned and the flight is not open on the work station.  Unable to research further without the information from the station.   This does not appear to be an attributable flight delay to the SNAPP application.

SNAPP SUPPOT COMMENTS - Research shows the gate reader dropped the connection to SNAPP.  This is not a SNAPP attributable flight delay.
The steps to quickly recover the gate reader follow:  Do not reboot the work station unless the steps below fail.
These steps correct the problem 95% of the time and a reboot only corrects the problem about 5% of the time.

You must know where the power switches are on the gate reader printer and the gate reader itself to recover quickly.

1. Exit the flight in SNAPP and then logoff of SNAPP.
2. Shut down SNAPP using ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4.
3. Click YES to shut down all active browsers.
4. Turn off the gate reader printer.
5. Turn off the gate reader itself.
6. Turn on the gate reader printer.
7. Turn on the gate reader itself.
8. Start SNAPP and then reopen the flight in SNAPP.
9. If no test receipt, call the HELP DESK to create a ticket for the Field OPS Team to check the gate reader, gate reader printer,
   and the work station connections. Prepare to manually board the flight, via SNAPP.


FO COMMENTS _ user said nothing would scan during flt. they where logged in to the controlling set for the gate reader did specify flt 2904. I logged off user and tested the scanner with a atbbchk test print and it did scan it and printed out a tag. also printed out a tag when users logged into flt. please look into seems to be some thing else not equipment.

NSTR - Called and spoke with Donna.  She said the reader started working after the reboot that was being done with the help desk was disconnected.  She also stated this wasn't the first reboot she tried but this one worked.  Verified no delay was taken.   Advised that if problem does return, the next step would be to check for a loose cable as link down indicates a lack of communication between the gatereader and the PC software.

1. Exit the flight in SNAPP and then logoff of SNAPP.
2. Shut down SNAPP using ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4.
3. Click YES to shut down all active browsers.
4. Turn off the gate reader printer.
5. Turn off the gate reader itself.
6. Turn on the gate reader printer.
7. Turn on the gate reader itself.
8. Start SNAPP and then reopen the flight in SNAPP.
9. If no test receipt, call the HELP DESK to create a ticket for the Field OPS Team to check the gate reader, gate reader printer,
   and the work station connections. Prepare to manually board the flight, via SNAPP.

-Called and spoke with Sandy.
-She said the scanner was working for the flight this morning, but comes and goes at will.
-Investigated issue and it appears to be caused by a checkstone timeout between snapp and checkstone to the gate reader.

**Title from related Incident record IM3026903:
Flight Delay - gate reader issue","Related Incident IM3026903 closed.
Research shows the gate reader dropped the connection to SNAPP.  This is not a SNAPP attributable flight delay.
The steps to quickly recover the gate reader follow:  Do not reboot the work station unless the steps below fail.
These steps correct the problem 95% of the time and a reboot only corrects the problem about 5% of the time.

You must know where the power switches are on the gate reader printer and the gate reader itself to recover quickly.

1. Exit the flight in SNAPP and then logoff of SNAPP.
2. Shut down SNAPP using ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+F4.
3. Click YES to shut down all active browsers.
4. Turn off the gate reader printer.
5. Turn off the gate reader itself.
6. Turn on the gate reader printer.
7. Turn on the gate reader itself.
8. Start SNAPP and then reopen the flight in SNAPP.
9. If no test receipt, call the HELP DESK to create a ticket for the Field OPS Team to check the gate reader, gate reader printer,
   and the work station connections. Prepare to manually board the flight, via SNAPP.

Research of the work station shows this is an ongoing problem created by two separate data collection tools installed on Delta Air Lines proprietary work stations to collect system information.  These two applications will take up too much CPU resources and this is the reason the gate reader is scanning slowly.   This is not a SNAPP issue and the problem cannot be corrected until after the summer season.   At this time, there is nothing that can be done to prevent this gate reader slow down from happening.
