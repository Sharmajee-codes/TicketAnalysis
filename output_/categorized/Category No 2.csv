user got an email  from John Demko
It looks like the installation has errors which would need to be addresses by the Software Center group.

You will need to contact the Help Desk & request they open an Incident Report to the Software Center group.

The key is they have to open an Incident Report ( not an IShop ) to get the issue looked into & corrected for you.
