Extended Recovery Issue, vendor coordination to resolve.

1.	Hitachi Password Manger Server/Application reported having issues that passwords are no longer synchronizing
a.	Weekly PSUPDATE Job, Runs Weekly each Wednesday 23:00, this job initiated on primary Hitachi ID Password Management server [SATLRCCAPDC501.auxprd.delta.com] as expected and sent job start notification
This is an automated notification from the SSPM servers.

Message: PSUPDATE is running; password changes should be avoided.
Time occurred: 11/30/16 23:06:15 CST

b.	Job completion notification not received

2.	PushPass Service was running on [SATLRCCAPDC501.auxprd.delta.com]; and restarted via Native Web Interface
a.	Upon PushPass Service restart, PSUPDATE  job end notification was received
This is an automated notification from the SSPM servers.

Message: Starting psstartpushpass. All SSPM functions are resumed.
Time occurred: 12/01/16 09:10:31 CST

3.	Further investigation, identified that pushPass service would start and stop without interaction, anomalous.
a.	Investigation of EVENT Logs identified multiple EVENTID ‘0’ items, eg:
Identified Corrupt MAINDB and PUSHPASS inoperable on primary Hitachi ID Password Management server [SATLRCCAPDC501.auxprd.delta.com]

Identified Corrupt MAINDB and PUSHPASS inoperable on primary Hitachi ID Password Management server [SATLRCCAPDC501.auxprd.delta.com]

Completed manual pack and re-index of all database files
Removed corrupted primary server from Native Web Utility/Push pass operations via load balancer
Rebuilt anomalous sized database for SessionLog,SessionData and Fail
Tested and confirmed PushPass services start properly following performed tasks

b.	Investigation of EVENT Logs identified multiple EVENTID ‘0’ items, eg:
The description for Event ID 0 from source CodeBase Error cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.

If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.

The following information was included with the event:

Codebase error -1110 [Memo File Corrupt] (long code 90039 [f4memoReadLow])

4.	Upon identifying and further testing start of pushpass services, it was identified that Codebase error -1110 [Memo File Corrupt] [f4memoReadLow] error references , table corruption within a core database file for the P-Sync Hitachi ID Password Software
a.	Per Support and Documented workflow procedures, identified vendor coordination required and engaged Hitachi ID
i.	SECIDM Sharepoint: http://sharepoint.delta.com:3231/sites/SECIDM/Wiki/Wiki%20Pages/AD%20-%20Self%20Service%20Password%20Manager,%20SSPM%20(Hitachi%20ID%20Password%20Manager).aspx
5.	In coordination with Hitachi, began review and synopsis of current Hitachi Application Functionality on Primary and Secondary Server systems
Master Sync System
•	SATLRCCAPDC501.auxprd.delta.com
o	RDP = 10.65.219.39  Primary IP = 159.165.36.171
o	SSPM Site: IIS Binding: 159.165.36.171, Port 80/443
o	Register Site: IIS Binding: 159.165.36.167, Port 80/443

o	Register Site: IIS Binding: 159.165.36.169, Port 80/443

6.	Large or Corrupt Database files cause inconsistencies in weekly reconciliation PSUPDATE tasks and can also lead degraded performance and processing of Password synchronization activities  controlled by the Hitachi ID Password management software.
a.	Once this was identified, the primary Master sync system [SATLRCCAPDC501.auxprd.delta.com] was disabled at the load balancer and the secondary sync system [SATLRCCAPDC502.auxprd.delta.com] was enabled, this would not immediately resolve issue, but would allow the Website/Native password management site sspm.delta.com to function while repair methods are completed on the primary server system.
b.	All DBF files on primary server system, were packed and re-indexed via built in utility for database management of P-Synch, this process reports data inconsistences and repairs table inconstancies within each database
•	account.dbf
•	admin.dbf
•	did.dbf
•	expiry.dbf
•	fail.dbf
•	history.dbf
•	host.dbf
•	itsmmail.dbf
•	itsmtarget.dbf
•	itsmticket.dbf
•	lock.dbf
•	madmin.dbf
•	malias.dbf
•	nfyprecond.dbf
•	notify.dbf
•	platcat.dbf
•	platform.dbf
•	pwdpol.dbf
•	qdef.dbf
•	qset.dbf
•	queue.dbf
•	remove.dbf
•	response.dbf
•	schedule.dbf
•	sessdat.dbf
•	sesskey.dbf
•	sesslog.dbf

•	strength.dbf
•	system.dbf
•	tgroup.dbf
•	user.dbf
•	userauth.dbf
•	usernotif.dbf
•	userstat.dbf
•	xtgroup.dbf
7.	In coordination with Hitachi, reviewed results and confirmed that initial pack and re-index of database files reported no explicit failure errors and this table inconsistencies resolved.
a.	Attempted multiple initiation attempts of push pass services, this lead to monitored results that performance and transparent sync is still not operable to acceptable or expected state.
8.	All data and settings were reviwed on primary and secondary systems
a.	During this extended time-period of log, settings and application review we attempted multiple efforts including bypassing the loadbalancer for target systems initiating password changes, Process Moniotr review on systems, network, latency testing, this effort extended due to the P-Sync application not reporting any functional or operational errors itself.
b.	Also, the pushpass windows services itself was experiencing restarts and slow/start stop operation processing.
9.	It was determined, that next course of action would be to bring primary Sync system behind load balancer again, to bring that configuration back to original state, and then review and align adavanced logging files on TYarget domain controllers and also the master sync systems themselves.
a.	The inconsistent and intermittent performance, slow processing of password synchronization led to Hitachi team members reviewing explicit operational items for this version of psynch version 6.4.9 (bear 4732) software.
10.	It was determined, that this version of software is sensitive to DBF file size and also interruption in proper processing.
11.	The next best course of determined action was to stop all push pass operations and Hitachi  identified that 3 specific database’s results, identify database must be re-generate through built in database management utility
a.	Sesslog.dbf
b.	Sessdat.dbf
c.	Fail.dbf
12.	Once these operations completed, all p-sync push pass services operations, including windows service stayed online and operational with no failures.
a.	Monitoring and continued advanced troubleshooting efforts to investigate Windows Platform, Network and other systems performance were coordinated as all efforts continued to identify the significant delay now occurring with transparent password synchronization
i.	Identified through-out evening as password taking up to 15-20 minutes to initiate and sync to different targets for a single user
b.	Reviewed Optimization and performance settings
i.	This included configuring additional settings to minimize required session/lock file creation that explicitly creates a session lock file only allowing password changes to occur for a user whom has a lock file to the target syst"

Subject: FW: Incident Ticket IM2918136 has been opened in your queue.

Hello Twila,

I set the password of your ID B2125A in Top Secret with a temporary password formatted as:

1.            The first initial of your first name, the first initial of your last name, followed by the last 4 digits of your PMNW user ID, followed by the letters “xx” (lowercase only)
2.            The initials are chosen from your legal name, not a nickname that someone may be known by:
                a.            Example:  John Smith = js1234xx (assuming 1234 are the last 4 digits of his PMNW user ID)
                b.            Example:  Richard Smith (goes by Dick Smith) = rs1234xx (assuming 1234 are the last 4 digits of his PMNW user ID and Richard is the legal first name)



Thank you.

HP Service Manager Operator: 169727
Subject:   Thank you for contacting the Help Desk regarding your password
Dear PAUL JESSUP,
 The Service Desk has provided you a temporary password for per your request.  If you did not request a temporary password please call the Service Desk immediately 1-888-714-0529 or 4-HELP and reference SD3909589
 You will need to create a new password of your own choosing as soon as possible to complete the tempoarty password process.  For the most common password resets ( DeltaNet, Windows, Email, DBMS, Icrew, Corp AD, Sceptre, TSO, Passport AD, Travelnet) the following guidelines for passwords and self-service password resets apply.
•         Your new password must be “exactly“ 8 characters long, must include a letter and a number, or @, #, $.  It cannot be a word found in the dictionary, a proper name, or your name or employee id. It cannot contain more than 2 pairs of repeating characters.  Your new password cannot be any password you have used in the previous 12 months.
 •         For your information, there are two self-service password tools that are available to you on the Deltanet Portal Information Technology page: http://dlnet.delta.com/portal/os/Pages/Service+Desk
  •         You can also go to the page directly at the following web address:
o    Password Management SSPM:  sspm.delta.com (Windows, Email, DeltaNet, iCrew)
o    Password Management  PASS:  register.delta.com   (Windows, Email, DeltaNet, iCrew, Deltamatic)
 For other password resets such as: SAP, Voice Mail, Cargo, Webvision, SNAPP, Endeavor, MLT, these tools do not apply and the rules are not as restrictive.
 In the future we encourage you to use the self-service tools whenever possible, or you can ask us to assist using our chat tool. Simply click on the Chat With IT Service Desk from the IT portal.
Reminder, passwords need to be reset every 90","Advised theuser to try logging in with the same password user stated it works.

Identified ID scenario, of MVS target ID match to staffid, causing multiple targets not to be populated. IDMLM working through updates to batch process to resolve identified scenario causing the account not be listed as password target.

Regarding this scenario, will be making batch processing updates to avoid these circumstances in the future. These updates will be implemented via an urgent RFC in the upcoming week.

Sent the requestor an email...

Derek

I have reviewed your incident regarding the inability to access web links in CFDELTA and CFIDELTA for password validation.  The URL’s you provided point to the old Citrix Web Interface servers.  As I am in the midst of a Citrix upgrade, this environment has been upgraded to Storefront servers.  These issues that you are experiencing are due to the way the favorites were saved.  In the old Web Interface environment, if you entered http://citrixdev.delta.com, you would immediately hit a redirect page that would update your address line.  This is the reason the favorite includes /Citrix/Metaframe/auth/login.aspx.

To resolve, you will need to update your favorites to only include the base URL…  The following represents what the links should reflect…

CFDELTA – https://citrixdev.delta.com
CFITDELTA – https://citrixcf.delta.com
DELTA – http://citrix.delta.com

Note:  In the labs, you will see a Certificate Warning…  This is OK as the reason for the certificate warning is due to the fact that we are using internal certificates and your workstation does not have the ROOT CA for the labs.

I am going to update and close the incident.  If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know…

Thanks

Chris Shriner

From the analysis, it is seen that user tired to change the password and there were multiple invalid security id and invalid password attempts and session was expired which caused the Snapp to Auto LogOff. Password changing will be based on agents authority. Snapp is designed such a way that when no action is performed in a certain time it will Log off automatically.

Kelly tried several different ways to get to the SRS/ASAP link and logging out/in.  Finally it accepted her ID and password.  It is unknown what caused the error.  She was using her Asis computer which is Windows10 and the Google Chrome browser.  FSR is only certified for Windows7 IE11 although it may work for other browsers.

Description: An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine.

Details: To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on remote machines, please create a <customErrors> tag within a ""web.config"" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application.

Hi Chayci,
We received email from IT help Desk that you are unable to log into Concur.
Are you on a special assignment?  Typically pilots do not use Concur unless they are on some sort of special assignment or are working in a management position.  Please advise the reason why you require access to Concur.  Pilots with expenses incurred during their rotations should be submitting them through iCrew for reimbursement.

If your expenses are related to your rotation, you likely should not be using Concur.

Please confirm before we proceed any further. (I am attaching Concur Access & Update Form just in case you are on special assignment and need to use Concur, please complete and return via email and I will set up your profile).

Thank you,
Darina
