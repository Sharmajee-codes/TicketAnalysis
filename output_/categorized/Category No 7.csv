Delta Air Lines users pretty much have access to their deleted items using Outlook Recover Deleted Items tool. Please note that Delta standard policy is email hygiene which is performed daily, which moves items older than 60 days. These items will be moved to purge, at which point, they remain for 7 days.

The only option available to restore e-mails is a feature on your outlook client named ""Recover Deleted Items"", If you do not find the messages under Recover Deleted Items means those messages were already purged from the Servers. Delta Policy is go to the tape in instance of catastrophic failure only.

This is the policy applied for all Delta's users and to not happen this again we recommend create PST files, store it on File Servers (HomeDrive) in order to save important e-mails. If you have any doubts or questions about how to do that Field Ops Team can assist you.

User cannot access some of his PST folders in OUTLOOK","Related Incident IM2843091 closed.
Someone deleted the ""Default"" profile in the C:\Users. User logging in was having a temp folder created for his local PC profile. Whoever looked at this before, renamed his profile and I could not delete his newly created temp folder - until I renamed his x941832 profile folder to just his employee number, copy it for insurance, and, then, was able to delete the temp profile - (some how the temp folder had hooks into the renamed folder and attempting to delete it indicated the folder was still in use. Copied a good Default folder from a known good LMTC PC and tested it with my personal Delta domain login. Called Peter Shanahan just as I finished, he logged in to create a fresh local profile. Pete stated the PC is running significantly faster. Told him to inform Gary Duncan what I did and tell him he should be okay now, too. Close. dringel

I am hoping someone can answer a few questions.  2 months ago our general Museum mailbox (Delta_Museum, museum.delta@delta.com) was converted from a “personal account” that required a computer log in and password to an SSGM-type of account after our mailbox was noted as inactive.  (Ticket Q925959)   I need to now share our general museum calendar (Delta, Museum) with two of my employees and I am having trouble figuring out how to do that.
I’ve logged onto the SSGM webpage for the first time and see that I can add members at different access levels.
First, does this apply to the mailbox only or does it also include the calendar?
Second, only myself and one coworker (Greg Romanoski) are currently listed as members.  Right now, there are other Museum employees with various levels of access to our Inbox and Calendar, but their names are not listed as SSGM members.
If I add them as SSGM members, will this affect their current access levels, and would it change the steps they take to check
I'd sent an email to secops@delta.com on Nov. 10th and never heard a response.

Outlook hanging -","Related Incident IM2871546 closed.
Spoke with Ryan  and he was having trouble with his set locking up whenever he logged off OR when I tried to log him off so I could log in as Admin. Once I finally logged in as Admin I ran GPUpdate and that seemed to resolve the logging off issue. He said that he was recently working from Germany and this just started today. He logged back in and I completely recreated his Outlook profile. I mapped his (5GB) .pst and told him that it needed to be split so I made a NEW .pst and showed him how to move files (safely) so that they didn't get lost. Everything seems to be working correctly at this point.

Here's what you need to do to fix it:

1. On the phone, open the E-Mail app
2. Hit the Menu Key > Settings > General Settings
3. Select Spam Addresses and look for any errant email addresses, especially *@yourdomain.com entries, which would filter any messages from your domain.
4. Remove those addresses

Now the user can move the messages out of the Unwanted Folder and delete that folder, and email will stop being filtered improperly.

Someone else is asking to nest in a distribution list
Here is the question - I can direct them to increase the size but don't have an answer on the nesting piece.  I just created 9 distribution lists for Outlook and they were created in SSGM. In accessing the list shell to add the names, I noticed the list size is too small. I also need to add nesting options to the lists. The instructions on the SSGM site indicate an iShop request is required to increase the size, but no form is indicated and the IT Generic form requires information that is not applicable to the request. How can the size be increased?? Also, several of these lists will be nested. The information in the email I received indicates an iShop request is required for this action as well, but no form indicated. Which form is to be used?? Maybe the initial form needs to query the size needed and if a nesting option is necessary.
This is urgent as leadership team needs these lists completed ASAP. Thanks!

Hi B'Nard David and I are meeting regarding the Collaterals in his office; can you join us?  Thanks""

I closed Outlook client, removed Outlook from his Android from Airwatch, and logged into OWA.

I then set up a rule to filter out any messages with a subject equal to the above, and delete them upon arrival.

As of this call, I was about to delete about 4000 emails and stop the incoming flood.

Please check on user.

outlook data recovery","Related Incident IM2901486 closed.
Delta Air Lines users pretty much have access to their deleted items using Outlook Recover Deleted Items tool. Please note that Delta standard policy is email hygiene which is performed daily, which moves items older than 60 days. These items will be moved to purge, at which point, they remain for 7 days.

The only option available to restore e-mails is a feature on your outlook client named ""Recover Deleted Items"", If you do not find the messages under Recover Deleted Items means those messages were already purged from the Servers. Delta Policy is go to the tape in instance of catastrophic failure only.

This is the policy applied for all Delta's users and to not happen this again we recommend create PST files, store it on File Servers (HomeDrive) in order to save important e-mails. If you have any doubts or questions about how to do that Field Ops Team can assist you.

Since there is not action on your incident we are considering it as closed.

This issue is not caused by Exchange server, but due a bug with iphone devices.
Our suggestion is following the workarounds below until Apple fix this issue.

- When creating a new appointment in Outlook, do not include yourself as an attendee. If you are using a distribution group to invite others, expand that group and remove yourself as an attendee.
- Checks for pending updates on iphone devices.
Since there is no more actions on your incident we are considering it as closed.

customer was missing her .pst file. Her .OST file is over 4gb. I searched several locations and was unable to find anything substantial. I searched (personal folders) from the RUN command and noticed a personal folder that seemed to be on her desktop. THAT was the one she was looking for. I was able to map it in her Outlook and she verified that this was what she needed. She ALSO has an external HD so I created a new folder (.pst BACKUP) and copied her .pst to that as an archive. I showed her how to update it weekly so that she will always have a good copy. Customer is very happy.

Related Incident IM2918910 closed.
This issue is not caused by Exchange server, but due a bug with iphone devices.
Our suggestion is following the workarounds below until Apple fix this issue.

- When creating a new appointment in Outlook, do not include yourself as an attendee. If you are using a distribution group to invite others, expand that group and remove yourself as an attendee.
- Checks for pending updates on iphone devices.
Since there is no more actions on your incident we are considering it as closed.

Called into Helpdesk, one of the Techs went through and deleted old passwords saved into the computer.
User was prompted again some time later and has called in again.
User was not locked out. Remoted into PC and Microsoft Otlook showed connected and up to date.
User had typed his email address intot he Username box of the credential pop up.
I closed Outlook, reopened it and it connected, did not prompt for credentials,.
I advised User that sometimes a network connection drop will cause Outlook to prompt for credentials and if he is able to close Outlook and reopen it without issue than that is what it was.
User says this is ""impacting my work, there is something wrong with my configuration"".
He is requesting a rebuild to stop this from happening.

I have been connected to his machine for 10 minutes and the pop up box has not returned.

Subject: IM2966244-Outlook Indexing.


Good Morning Austin,


I have attached the steps for you to perform to assist you with your “Indexing” issue.
•	Go to File > Options
•	In Search settings, click Indexing Options…
•	Click Modify
•	Un-check Microsoft Outlook from the list of Indexed Locations
•	Close Outlook completely and check the Task Manager (ctrl+alt+del) to see if no Outlook processes are running
•	Find the location of your PST or OST files
o	Go to File > Account Settings > Account Settings
o	Click on the Data Files tab
o	Select your Outlook file from the list and click Open File Location…
•	Right click on the .pst or .ost file and click Properties
•	Click Advanced
•	Make sure that the box next to ‘Allow this file to have contents indexed in addition to file’ is checked.
•	Click OK
Follow the steps outlined in step 2. Make sure this time that the box next to Microsoft Outlook is checked.
Give Outlook a little time to check the state of the indexing. It may be that it needs to add new items to the index. After a few minutes, you can try searching again.
•	In Outlook 2013 click on the File tab, then click Options > Search
•	Click Indexing Options
•	You should now see what locations are being indexed. Click Advanced
•	Under Troubleshooting, click Rebuild
•	Rebuilding will take some time so make sure to leave your PC running for a while, preferably when you don’t need to work with it since indexing can impact the speed of your computer.
•	In Outlook 2013 click on the File tab, then click Options > Search
•	Click Indexing Options
•	You should now see what locations are being indexed. Click Advanced
•	Under Troubleshooting, click Rebuild
•	Rebuilding will take some time so make sure to leave your PC running for a while, preferably when you don’t need to work with it since indexing can impact the speed of your computer.
If you still can’t find the email you’re looking for, there may be a problem with your index. Rebuilding the index in Outlook 2013 isn’t too difficult, only time consuming. Here’s how to rebuild:
•	In Outlook 2013 click on the File tab, then click Options > Search
•	Click Indexing Options
•	You should now see what locations are being indexed. Click Advanced
•	Under Troubleshooting, click Rebuild
•	Rebuilding will take some time so make sure to leave your PC running for a while, preferably when you don’t need to work with it since indexing can impact the speed of your computer.


 Please follow the steps in the attached document. If you still require my assistance, let me know. Thanks!

Emailed the below to user:

Hi Eri,

The Email Exchange Server Support team transferred your ticket to us to investigate the issue further. Unfortunately, this issue is actually a known issue with Apple ActiveSync in Outlook 2016. There have been vast numbers of people (consumers) complaining this very issue that you reported. There is not a solution that we can deploy or implement locally besides suggesting to you the below work-around to see if it will help. Internally, we have received many of this same issue before.

The issue could be related to someone in the distribution list accepted certain meeting invites on their IPhone and Outlook client on their PC or laptop. Also, could be where your ActiveSync continues to synch emails and calendar meetings where it continues to send out old and same invite over and over again.

Suggestion(s) that may help fix this.

-	Disable iCloud sync on all of your iDevices, iPhone, iPad, Mac Outlook machine for both calendar and reminders sync that should resolve your issue.
-	From what I understand a workaround is to disable the time to leave feature (TTL) on your device. Settings > Calendar > Default Alert Times > disable Time to Leave.

The above does not guaranteed to work or fix the issue but worth a try. Apple and Microsoft have not gotten any fix for this problem yet.

It appears that the incident has been closed – So what I suggest is to contact the help desk to have a new incident opened and they can associate to the one mentioned below.

I cannot reopen the incident therefore in order to get it to the correct team the Help Desk will have to be involved.

Yes, I understand that emails are making it to the mailbox, but only the internal emails, not the external.

How can I tell if this is still open?  I never advised that it was corrected and it should never have been closed.  If it is closed, can it not be reopened and escalated?  I don’t think I should have to go through the Help Desk again for this issue when it wasn’t resolved in the first place.

Thanks,
Shannon

This is not an Exchange Server issue. Exchange servers only handle transport and storage of messages. The message processing is done via Outlook/OWA and other mobile applications. We do not handle iPhone/iPads settings on the user's mobile devices.

 Recommendations:
1. Do NOT use a mobile device to process or schedule meeting requests. Use a desktop client or web client to schedule meetings.
2. Do NOT schedule recurring meetings for longer than 6 months.  Start a new series instead.
3. When creating a new appointment, do NOT include yourself as an attendee.
4. If you are inviting a distribution group/list, expand that group/list and REMOVE yourself as an attendee before sending the invite.

Since that we have another ticket (IM3005785) related to this issue, this one will be closed as duplicated.

Hello Wayde,

                I was reaching out to you in regards to the above ticket. The below information is from the support group.

                The shared mailbox IFS, LOMockUpShop does not have a security group associated to it, which can control the mailbox. However, it has a 'send on behalf' list; but the user 706293 is not present in that list as well.
Ideally, the shared mailbox should be made controlled by an SSGM enabled security group. Please have the user raise an Ishop request for this, in the form Communications > Create/Modify/Delete Group Email Accounts, Mailboxes, ConfRms .  The user may add all these details as well.

We got your ticket in our queue about the issue with the meeting requests. Actually this is an issue caused by the iPhone devices, and so far Apple did not released a fix for it.

 For now, the recommendations:
1. Do NOT use a mobile device to process or schedule meeting requests. Use a desktop client or web client to schedule meetings.
2. Do NOT schedule recurring meetings for longer than 6 months.  Start a new series instead.
3. When creating a new appointment, do NOT include yourself as an attendee.
4. If you are inviting a distribution group/list, expand that group/list and REMOVE yourself as an attendee before sending the invite.

I will close your current ticket since that we have another ticket (IM3005785) related to this issue.
